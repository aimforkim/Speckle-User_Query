# Speckle-User_Query
Speckle: User Side for Querying Offcuts and Logs

## Description
From the project, Stream of Outcasts, these are two grasshopper scripts for the user end. These scripts guide the users on how to receive from the speckle stream, and demonstrate samples on how to query through the available geometrical and non-geometrical data of the available wood before choosing which wood to receive the full package, which includes the mesh data.
